# Swing System App for Cellular Sales

## Overview
The Swing System App is a queue management solution developed to solve a common challenge at my Cellular Sales local store. This application streamlines customer assignments, ensuring fair distribution of sales opportunities while providing real-time visibility into the queue status.

Please note that after periods of inactivity, the site may take a few seconds to load as the Render-hosted server wakes up from sleep mode.

## Problem Statement
At Cellular Sales, we faced several challenges with our manual swing system:
- Difficulty tracking which sales rep should get the next customer
- Confusion when handling customers
- No visibility into queue status across the sales floor
- Inconsistent application of queue rules when shifts change
- Lack of data on customer volume and rep performance

## Features

### Queue Tasking
- The reps understood that their order was based on who clocked in for the day
- The first in order got the next customer
- Reps sign in at the start of their shift, press the help button
- When a customer walks in, the system assigns the customer to the rep at the top with a status of busy

### Real-time Updates
- Using Socket.IO and Firebase, the system updates in real time
- Reps can immediately see who's next, who is busy, and how many customers are waiting

### Wait Time and Total Customers
- Reps can see how long customers have been waiting based on when they walked in
- After each rep finishes with a customer, their total customers increases by 1
- If a group came in, the rep still helps the group which counts as 1 customer

### Authentication
- Reps log in using their work email and password (managed via Firebase Authentication)
- This allows them to assign themselves to a specific customer

### Queue Visibility
- All reps can see current queue order and their position

### Reset Rep
- This feature allows reps to reset their position in the queue
- Used in rare cases when the customer didn't count (fraud, abuse, or chaotic event)

### Add and Remove Customer
- This feature allows reps to add a customer to the queue and remove one if needed
